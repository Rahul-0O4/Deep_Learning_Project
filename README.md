# Deep_Learning_Project
# Overview
This project implements a Deep Learning pipeline for Brain Tumor Detection and Classification using MRI scans. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning techniques to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor brain images.

The workflow covers data preprocessing, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and visualization to provide a robust solution for medical imaging applications.
